<h4>
** Calling all PhDs and Early Career Researchers (ECRs) **
</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Who is this for?</h4>
<p> 
Are you a PhD/ECR working on topics in Trust, Identity, Privacy and Security (TIPS)? 
</p>

<h4>What is TAPESTRY?</h4> 
<p> 
TAPESTRY is a socio-technical study of trust in online identities – the psychology of how trust is engendered on and off-line, how we can design for trust, and how emerging technologies such as AI and Blockchain can help create tools that enable us to make better trust decisions online. Further information can be found here (<a href="https://youtu.be/PN0xRiJHPzY">1 minute explainer video</a> or on the project website (<a href="https://www.tapestry.ac.uk">www.tapestry.ac.uk</a>).
</p>

 
<h4>What’s happening?</h4>
<p>
We are running a facilitated sandpit workshop on 3-4 February to explore novel applications of research outcomes from the EPSRC / UKRI Digital Economy funded TAPESTRY project For more information on Sandpits, see these <a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/applicationprocess/routes/network/ideas/whatisasandpit/">resources from the EPSRC</a> - but note this event is being run by the TAPESTRY team not EPSRC (please apply using our EOI form). The sandpit will be highly multi-disciplinary and we welcome applications from all disciplines across Sciences, Arts and Humanities.
</p>

<p>
As part of the Sandpit, participants will learn more about the TAPESTRY project. They will then form teams, and develop proposals to explore new uses of the social insights and technical tools that have been developed during TAPESTRY. We will award £10,000 of funding at the Sandpit, across the top three proposals. The three successful teams will then have three months to deliver their mini-projects, before attending a follow-up workshop to present a report on their research.
