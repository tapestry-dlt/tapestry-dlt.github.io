    name: Dr Jo Briggs
    position: Senior Research Fellow in Design, Northumbria University
    bio: 'Jo leads the trusted design workpackage on TAPESTRY, contributing to both the design of workshops exploring trust and of the visualization and UX aspects of the TAPESTRY platform.  Jo's research explores practice-led design approaches to explore complex and/or emergent digital-socio systems primarily across two interconnecting themes: design for digital engagement; and the design, use and ‘disruptive’ effects of peer-to-peer systems and platforms (e.g. crowdfunding, timebanking). Methodologically she is interested in the theory and practice of design approaches (e.g. Participatory Design, co-design and digital prototyping) and wider creative practices within multidisciplinary and/or cross-sectoral research, including that situated ‘in the wild’. She is a member of the ESRC and AHRC Peer Review Colleges and have reviewed for EPSRC. Shes also reviews for a range of international HCI Design conferences which this year included acting as Associate Chair (Design) for DIS2016 and 2017. She has led two RCUK projects as PI and two as CI and as well as numerous small network and other grants from a range of funders.'

    name: Dr Arthi Manohar 
    position: Lecturer, Brunel University
    bio: "Arthi worked on TAPESTRY for approximately two years as a design research fellow at Northumbria University. She has since moved to a full lectureship at Brunel.  Before joining Northumbria, she worked at the Glasgow School of Art where she explored co-design in community engagement and creative evaluation approaches through research and project-based learning. Prior to GSA, she worked at the Mixed Reality Lab within the University of Nottingham. Her Doctorate was a part of an EPSRC Digital Economy project ‘Tales of Things and Electronic Memories’ (TOTeM). Her research explored the digital impact of technologies on communities using Participatory Research Methods and Story Cultures. She holds a Master’s degree in Architecture and Digital Media from University of Westminster, London. Her research interests are particularly concerned with the role of human values to change the way we engage with communities to help us be more creative, responsive and reflective by investigating the relationship between the social design and technology."

    name: Dr Helen Jones
    position: Lecturer, UCLAN
    bio: 'Helen worked on TAPESTRY for approximately eighteen months as a postdoctoral research fellow under Moncur at the University of Dundee.  She has since taken up a full lectureship at UCLAN.  Helen's background is in cyberpsychology, and she previously completed her PhD at Lancaster University. This research examined psychological factors influencing susceptibility to email fraud, including cognitive (e.g. inhibition, cognitive reflection) and situational (e.g. email relevance, time pressure) factors that affect this. She has also worked previously at the University of Central Lancashire, researching the role of behavioural and physiological signals in the detection of insider threat. Helen’s research on the TAPESTRY project focuses on understanding how users currently make trust decisions online. This incorporates social psychological perspectives on persuasion, social influence, and social identity to understand how trusting relationships develop between strangers online. This will inform the development of the TAPESTRY tool, providing insight into how trust decisions might be manipulated online and how user-centric security solutions can be designed to encourage more secure connectivity.'
